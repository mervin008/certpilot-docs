// `docs/api-reference.md` in the code repository is where the deep prose lives:
// what to send, what comes back, and why an endpoint behaves the way it does.
// It is two thousand lines of genuinely good explanation that, until now, was
// readable only by somebody who had cloned the code — which is precisely the
// audience that needs it least.
//
// This splits it on its H2 headings into one fragment per resource, so the
// generator can set each fragment beside the route table for the same resource.
// A reader then has the table and the examples on one page instead of holding
// two sites open.
//
// Same vendoring trade as routes.json: the docs build must not need a checkout
// of the code, so the fragments are committed here and this script closes the
// gap. `--check` is what CI runs.
